 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This site contains statistics and scientific test that can prove the impact VR has on the brain. For example neurological test in rats have shown that VR can lead to cognitive alteration within the brain.The neurons in the brain that is associated with spatial learning has behaved differently in virtual reality compared to the real world.12-13 years is the most popular age range for VR exposure. Video games has become a dominant pastime among young kids. The evidence suggests that virtual reality could lead to far stronger of an imprint to our brains than we think. For example Greg Noone was a VR user who would play long hours in an apocalyptic game. Noone claims that he would act as he was simulation leaving his house. He would frequently have problems engaging in the real world.</span><br>

Such as cybersickness which can cause the user to have a loss of spatial awareness, nausea, and disorientation.It has been proven that exposure to VR could begin to impact the ability of children to understand the distance of objects. Not only will your eyes be impacts but also the users ability to hear. Listening to high volume sound could damage the users ear drum. Sony suggests that users should use lower volume if they can't hear people around them. Visual content could also affect the users perception of reality. Google Daydream View stated that "If the content is frightening,violent, or anxiety provoking, it can cause your body to react physically".&nbsp; </small><br>
